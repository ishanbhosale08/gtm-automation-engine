### GTM Automation Engine Pattern & Plan Checklist
> Based on GTM Automation Engine's orchestrator guidance plugins/orchestrator/README.md#112-325.

- **Pattern Selection**: default to **pipeline** (Strategy → Creative → Channels → Optimization). Switch to **diamond/fan-out** when creative/analytics work can parallelize; note pattern choice in the plan header.
- **Plan Schema**: every `/campaign-orchestration` run must emit a JSON plan saved under `.claude/plans/plan-<timestamp>.json` with objective, complexity, stages, task IDs, parallelization block, context-passing notes, error handling, and success criteria.
- **Tool Hooks**: reference `docs/gtm-essentials.md` tools inside plan steps (Serena for code/landing-page patches, Context7 for doc lookups, Sequential Thinking for retros, Playwright for QA checkpoints).
- **Guardrails & Escalation**: define retry strategy (immediate vs modified), max retries (default 2), and escalation path (Campaign Strategist → RevOps lead) for failures.
- **Review Flow**: before execution, run the checklist from `docs/usage-guide.md#orchestration-best-practices` (agent availability, dependency validation, deliverables alignment).

## Coordination Protocols

### Communication Flow
```
1. Daily Standups: Quick sync between active agents
2. Phase Gates: Formal handoffs with deliverable review
3. Escalation Path: Issues → Lead Agent → Orchestrator
4. Feedback Loops: Performance data → All agents
```

### Decision Framework
```
if (performance < target) {
  1. Data Analyst identifies issue
  2. Relevant agent proposes solution
  3. Orchestrator approves change
  4. Implementation within 24 hours
}
```

### Quality Checkpoints
- Strategy approval before creative
- Creative review before channel setup
- Soft launch before full launch
- Daily optimization cycles
- Plan file updated when scope or owners change (keep `.claude/plans` log in sync).

### GTM Automation Engine-Inspired Safeguards
- **Retry strategy**: retry once immediately with adjusted parameters; on second failure, escalate to orchestrator for manual intervention.
- **Fallback agents**: if specialized agents unavailable, document substitutions (e.g., Content Strategist covering Copywriter) in the plan.
- **Escalation triggers**: if KPIs breach guardrails twice in 48h (see lifecycle-mapping skill), notify Marketing Director + RevOps lead.

- **Project Management**: Asana, Monday.com
- **Creative Tools**: Figma, Canva, Adobe
- **Marketing Platforms**: HubSpot, Marketo, Salesforce
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, Heap
