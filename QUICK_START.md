# 🚀 Quick Start Guide for GTM Teams

> **👋 Never used Claude Code before?** Check out our [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) first! It walks you through installation, setup, and your first commands step-by-step.

## 5-Minute Setup

### Recommended Baseline: GTM Essentials ⚙️
Before installing role-specific plugins, make sure the four GTM Essentials MCP tools are configured. They power code navigation, live docs, structured reasoning, and browser QA across GTM workflows.

1. Follow the installation guide in [`docs/gtm-essentials.md`](docs/gtm-essentials.md) to set up **Serena**, **Context7**, **Sequential Thinking**, and **Playwright**.
2. Verify each tool runs (`serena --help`, `context7 --version`, etc.) and record versions in `docs/audit-log.md` during onboarding.
3. Reference the "Usage Patterns" table in that doc to know which GTM plugins leverage each tool (e.g., marketing-analytics + Context7, campaign-orchestration + Sequential Thinking).

Once the essentials are installed, proceed with the role-specific steps below.
