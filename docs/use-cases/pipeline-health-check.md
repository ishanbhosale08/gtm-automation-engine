The plugin analyzes and provides:

**Overall Health Score:**
```
Pipeline Health: 72/100

✅ Strong Areas:
- Good stage distribution

- Adequate pipeline coverage (3.2x quota)

⚠️ Areas of Concern:
- 15 deals stalled >30 days

- 8 deals at risk of slipping this quarter
```

**Stage Analysis:**
```
Discovery: 45 deals, $2.3M
- Healthy velocity (avg 12 days)
- Good qualification rate

Demo: 22 deals, $1.8M
⚠️ Conversion issue: 18% (target: 35%)

   → Champion left company
   → Action: Find new champion or disqualify

   → Slipped 2 quarters
   → Budget concerns
   → Action: Requalify or move to nurture

Medium Risk (Monitor):

## Key Metrics Explained

### Pipeline Coverage Ratio
**Formula:** Total Pipeline Value ÷ Quota  
**Target:** 3-5x for most B2B sales  
**Example:** $3M pipeline ÷ $1M quota = 3x coverage

### Deal Velocity
**Formula:** Average days in each stage  
**Target:** Varies by stage and sales cycle  
**Example:** Discovery: 10-15 days, Demo: 7-10 days

### Conversion Rates
**Formula:** Deals moved to next stage ÷ Total deals in stage  
**Target:** Varies by stage  
**Example:** Demo → Proposal: 30-40%

### Stalled Deals
**Definition:** No activity in >14 days (or your threshold)  
**Action:** Re-engage or disqualify

## Best Practices

### Run Weekly
Make this a Monday morning ritual:
1. Export fresh data from CRM
2. Run pipeline audit
3. Identify top 3 actions
4. Share with team
5. Track progress

### Focus on Trends
Don't just look at point-in-time:
- Is health score improving?
- Are velocity trends positive?
- Are conversion rates stable?

### Take Action
Analysis without action is wasted:
- Assign owners to at-risk deals
- Set deadlines for re-engagement
- Track action completion

### Share Insights
Make it visible:
- Weekly team email
- Dashboard in CRM
- Leadership updates
- Rep coaching sessions
