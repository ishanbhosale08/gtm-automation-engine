## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Define Your ICP (2 minutes)

Before generating leads, get clear on who you're targeting. Answer these questions:

**Industry:**
- What industry/vertical? (e.g., "B2B SaaS", "Healthcare", "Fintech")

**Company Size:**
- How many employees? (e.g., "50-200", "200-1000", "1000+")

**Funding Stage:**
- What funding stage? (e.g., "Series A", "Series B+", "Bootstrapped")

**Geography:**
- Where are they located? (e.g., "United States", "San Francisco Bay Area", "Global")

**Example ICP:**
```
B2B SaaS companies
50-200 employees
Series A or Series B funded
Located in the United States
Selling to enterprise customers
```

### Step 2: Run the Lead Generation Command (1 minute)

1. Open Claude Code
2. Type or paste:
   ```
   /sales-prospecting:generate-leads
   ```
3. Press Enter

### Step 3: Describe Your ICP (1 minute)

When prompted, describe your ideal customer. You can use natural language:

**Example 1 (Detailed):**
```
Generate 100 leads for B2B SaaS companies with 50-200 employees, 
Series A or B funded, located in the United States, that sell to 
enterprise customers. Focus on companies in sales automation, 
marketing tech, or customer success platforms.
```

**Example 2 (Simple):**
```
100 fintech companies, 100-500 employees, Series B+, in New York
```

**Example 3 (Very Specific):**
```
E-commerce companies using Shopify Plus, $10M+ annual revenue,
based in California, with a marketing team of 5+ people
```

### Step 4: Review the Results (2 minutes)

The plugin will generate your lead list. Review the output:

**What you'll see for each lead:**
- Company name
- Website URL
- Industry/vertical
- Employee count
- Funding information
- Decision-maker names and titles
- Contact information (email, LinkedIn)
- Personalized talking points

**Example output:**
```
Company: Acme SaaS Inc.
Website: acmesaas.com
Industry: B2B SaaS - Sales Automation
Employees: 150
Funding: Series A ($15M, 2023)
Decision Maker: Jane Smith, VP of Sales
Email: jane.smith@acmesaas.com
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/janesmith
Talking Points:
- Recently raised Series A to expand sales team
- Using legacy CRM, likely evaluating modern solutions
- Hiring 5 new AEs this quarter
- Pain point: Manual prospecting slowing down team
```

### Step 5: Export to Your CRM (1 minute)

1. Click "Export to CSV" or copy the results
2. Import into your CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
3. Or copy individual leads to your outreach tool

```
"Companies that raised funding in the last 12 months"
"Companies actively hiring for [role]"
```
