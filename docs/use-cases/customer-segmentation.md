## Segmentation Frameworks

### RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

**Recency:** When did they last engage?
- Recent (0-30 days): Active
- Moderate (31-90 days): Declining
- Distant (90+ days): At risk

**Frequency:** How often do they engage?
- High (daily): Power users
- Medium (weekly): Regular users
- Low (monthly or less): Casual users

**Monetary:** How much revenue?
- High (top 20%): Champions
- Medium (middle 60%): Core
- Low (bottom 20%): Small accounts

### Behavioral Segmentation

**By Feature Usage:**
- Power users (5+ features)
- Core users (3-4 features)
- Basic users (1-2 features)
- Non-users (signed up, not using)

**By Growth Trajectory:**
- Expanding (usage increasing)
- Stable (usage flat)
- Declining (usage decreasing)
- Churned (no activity 90+ days)

### Value-Based Segmentation

**By LTV:**
- Whales (top 10%, $10K+ LTV)
- Dolphins (next 30%, $3K-10K LTV)
- Minnows (bottom 60%, <$3K LTV)

**By Potential:**
- High potential (small now, growing fast)
- Medium potential (stable, some growth)
- Low potential (maxed out, not growing)

## Advanced Analysis

### Cohort Analysis by Segment

Track how segments evolve over time:

```
January Cohort (100 customers):
Month 1: 80% New, 20% Rising Stars
Month 3: 50% Rising Stars, 30% Steady, 15% At Risk, 5% Champions
Month 6: 40% Champions, 35% Rising Stars, 20% Steady, 5% Churned
Month 12: 50% Champions, 30% Rising Stars, 15% Steady, 5% Churned
```

### Segment Migration

Track movement between segments:

```
Q3 → Q4 Segment Changes:
- 45 Rising Stars → Champions (upgrade success!)
- 30 Steady → Rising Stars (activation working)
- 25 At Risk → Steady (win-back success)
- 15 Steady → At Risk (need intervention)
- 20 At Risk → Churned (lost customers)
```

### Revenue Concentration

Understand revenue distribution:

```
Top 20% of customers = 70% of revenue (Champions + Rising Stars)
Middle 60% of customers = 25% of revenue (Steady Users)
Bottom 20% of customers = 5% of revenue (At Risk + New)
```

## Segmentation Best Practices

### Start Simple
Begin with 3-5 segments:
- High value, high engagement
- High value, low engagement
- Low value, high engagement
- Low value, low engagement
- New customers

### Use Multiple Dimensions
Don't segment on just one variable:
- Revenue + Engagement + Tenure
- Plan + Usage + Growth
- Industry + Size + Behavior

### Make It Actionable
Each segment should have:
- Clear definition
- Distinct characteristics
- Specific strategies
- Measurable goals

### Update Regularly
- Re-segment monthly or quarterly
- Track segment migration
- Refine criteria based on learnings
- Adjust strategies as segments evolve

### Automate Tracking
- Set up dashboards
- Create alerts for segment changes
- Automate segment-specific campaigns
- Monitor KPIs by segment

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Too Many Segments
**Problem:** 20 micro-segments are impossible to manage

**Solution:** Start with 5 segments, add more only if needed

### ❌ Static Segmentation
**Problem:** Segments defined once, never updated

**Solution:** Re-segment quarterly, track migration

### ❌ No Clear Actions
**Problem:** Interesting insights but no strategy

**Solution:** Define specific tactics for each segment

### ❌ Ignoring Small Segments
**Problem:** Focus only on Champions, ignore At Risk

**Solution:** Every segment needs a strategy (even if it's "let churn")
