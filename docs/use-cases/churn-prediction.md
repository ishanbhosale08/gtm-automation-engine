# Use Case: Predict and Prevent Customer Churn

## Overview

**Problem:** Customers churn unexpectedly and you don't know who's at risk until it's too late.

**Solution:** Use the `customer-analytics` plugin to identify at-risk customers and predict churn probability in under 10 minutes.

**Time Saved:** ~12 hours per month (from 15 hours to 3 hours)

**ROI:** At $100/hour, that's $1,200 saved per month + revenue saved from prevented churn

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Export Customer Data (5 minutes)

Export from your database/CRM with these fields:

**Account Information:**
- Customer ID
- Account name
- MRR/ARR
- Contract end date
- Tenure (months as customer)

**Usage Data:**
- Monthly active users

**Engagement Data:**
- Support tickets (count, severity)
- NPS score
- Product feedback submitted
- Event attendance
- Email engagement

**Billing Data:**
- Payment issues
- Downgrades
- Failed payments
- Discount/promotion usage

**Example CSV:**
```csv
customer_id,mrr,tenure_months,monthly_logins,last_login_days_ago,support_tickets_30d,nps,contract_days_remaining
CUST001,5000,24,45,2,1,9,180
CUST002,1200,6,3,45,8,3,90
```

### Step 2: Run Churn Prediction (3 minutes)

1. Open Claude Code
2. Run:
   ```
   /customer-analytics:predict-churn
   ```
3. Upload your CSV or paste the data
4. Specify your churn definition:

**Example Prompt:**
```
Analyze churn risk for our B2B SaaS customers.

Churn definition: No login in 60 days or contract not renewed

Analyze based on:
- Usage patterns (logins, feature adoption)
- Engagement (support, NPS, events)
- Account health (tenure, MRR, growth)
- Billing signals (payment issues, downgrades)

Goal: Identify customers at risk in next 90 days
```

### Step 3: Review Churn Analysis (5-10 minutes)

The plugin provides a comprehensive churn risk assessment:

## CHURN RISK OVERVIEW

**Total Customers Analyzed:** 1,247  
**At High Risk (>70%):** 89 customers ($267K MRR)  
**At Medium Risk (40-70%):** 156 customers ($312K MRR)  
**At Low Risk (<40%):** 1,002 customers ($2.1M MRR)

**Predicted Churn (Next 90 Days):**
- High risk: 62 customers (70% churn rate) = $187K MRR at risk
- Medium risk: 47 customers (30% churn rate) = $94K MRR at risk
- **Total at risk:** $281K MRR

**If No Intervention:**
- Expected churn: 109 customers
- Revenue loss: $281K MRR = $3.4M ARR
- With 35% save rate: Can save $98K MRR

## CHURN PREDICTION MODEL

### How It Works

**Data Inputs:**
- Usage patterns (frequency, depth, breadth)
- Engagement signals (support, NPS, events)
- Account characteristics (tenure, size, industry)
- Billing behavior (payment issues, downgrades)
- Relationship health (champion status, satisfaction)

**Scoring Algorithm:**
```
Churn Risk Score = 
  (Usage Score × 0.30) +
  (Engagement Score × 0.25) +
  (Support Score × 0.20) +
  (NPS Score × 0.15) +
  (Billing Score × 0.10)

Where each component is scored 0-100 (100 = highest risk)
```

**Risk Tiers:**
- 0-40%: Low risk (healthy)
- 40-70%: Medium risk (monitor)
- 70-100%: High risk (intervene)

### Model Accuracy

**Validation Results:**
- Precision: 82% (of predicted churns, 82% actually churn)
- Recall: 76% (catches 76% of actual churns)
- F1 Score: 0.79 (good balance)

**False Positives:** 18% (predicted churn but didn't)
- Still valuable to engage these customers

**False Negatives:** 24% (didn't predict but churned)
- Often due to external factors (budget cuts, acquisitions)

## MEASURING SUCCESS

### Churn Metrics to Track

**Churn Rate:**
```
Monthly Churn Rate = Churned Customers / Total Customers at Start
Target: <5% monthly for B2B SaaS
```

**Revenue Churn:**
```
Monthly Revenue Churn = Churned MRR / Total MRR at Start
Target: <3% monthly (net negative with expansion)
```

**Save Rate:**
```
Save Rate = Saved Customers / At-Risk Customers Contacted
Target: 30-50%
```

**Early Warning:**
```
% of Churns Predicted 60+ Days in Advance
Target: 70%+
```

### ROI Calculation

**Example:**
```
Customers at high risk: 89
Predicted to churn: 62 (70%)
Revenue at risk: $187K MRR

With intervention:
- Customers contacted: 89
- Time per customer: 4 hours avg
- Total time: 356 hours
- Cost: $35,600 (at $100/hour)

Results:
- Customers saved: 31 (35% save rate)
- Revenue saved: $93K MRR = $1.1M ARR
- ROI: 31x ($1.1M / $35.6K)
```
