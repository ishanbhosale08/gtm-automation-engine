## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Define Your Target (2 minutes)

Be specific about who you're reaching:

**Example Target:**
```
Role: VP of Sales
Company: B2B SaaS, Series A, 50-200 employees
Pain Point: Manual prospecting slowing down team
Goal: Book a 30-minute demo
```

### Step 2: Run the Sequence Builder (1 minute)

1. Open Claude Code
2. Run:
   ```
   /email-marketing:design-campaign
   ```
3. Describe your sequence:

**Example Prompt:**
```
Create a 5-email cold outreach sequence for VP of Sales at 
Series A B2B SaaS companies (50-200 employees).

Pain point: Their sales team is wasting time on manual prospecting
Solution: Our AI-powered prospecting tool saves 15 hours/week
Goal: Book a 30-minute demo
Tone: Professional but conversational, data-driven
```

### Step 3: Review the Sequence (2 minutes)

You'll get a complete sequence like this:

---

**EMAIL 1: Introduction (Day 0)**

**Subject:** Quick question about {{company}}'s sales process

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed {{company}} recently raised Series A and is scaling 
your sales team. Congrats!

Quick question: How much time does your team spend on manual 
prospecting each week?

Most VPs of Sales we work with tell us their reps spend 15-20 
hours/week researching leads and building lists. That's nearly 
half their time not actually selling.

We've helped companies like [Customer 1] and [Customer 2] cut 
prospecting time by 80% using AI automation.

Worth a quick 15-minute conversation?

Best,
{{your_name}}

P.S. Here's a 2-minute video showing how it works: [link]
```

**Send timing:** Immediately after lead is qualified

---

**EMAIL 2: Value Proof (Day 3)**

**Subject:** How [Customer Name] saved 60 hours/week

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Not sure if you saw my email from Tuesday, but wanted to share 
a quick case study that might be relevant.

[Customer Name] (similar size to {{company}}) was facing the 
same challenge - their 5 SDRs were spending 15 hours/week each 
on manual prospecting.

After implementing our solution:
• 75 hours/week saved across the team
• 3x more qualified leads generated
• 40% increase in meetings booked
• ROI in first month

Their VP of Sales said: "We got our SDRs back to actually 
selling instead of being researchers."

Want to see if we could deliver similar results for {{company}}?

Happy to do a quick 15-min screen share.

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Send timing:** 3 days after Email 1 if no response

---

**EMAIL 3: Different Angle (Day 7)**

**Subject:** {{first_name}}, thought you'd find this interesting

**Body:**
```
Hi {{first_name}},

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief.

I put together a quick analysis of {{company}}'s market based 
on your recent job postings and funding announcement.

Looks like you're hiring 3 new SDRs this quarter. At $75K 
salary each, that's $225K in new headcount.

What if you could get the same output with 2 SDRs instead of 3 
by automating their prospecting? That's $75K saved, plus faster 
time-to-productivity.

Here's a 1-page ROI calculator I built for companies your size:

Worth exploring?

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Send timing:** 7 days after Email 1 if no response

---

**EMAIL 4: Social Proof (Day 10)**

**Subject:** 47 B2B SaaS companies are using this

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Quick update: We just hit a milestone - 47 B2B SaaS companies 
(including 12 in your space) are now using our platform.

The common thread? They all had the same problem you might be 
facing:
- Sales team spending too much time on research
- Inconsistent lead quality
- Slow ramp time for new reps

Average results after 90 days:
• 18 hours/week saved per rep
• 2.5x more qualified leads
• 35% faster ramp for new hires

I'm not sure if this is a priority for {{company}} right now, 
but if it is, I'd love to show you how companies like 
[Competitor 1] and [Competitor 2] are using it.

15 minutes this week?

Best,
{{your_name}}
```

**Send timing:** 10 days after Email 1 if no response

---

**EMAIL 5: Breakup (Day 14)**

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about helping {{company}} automate 
prospecting and save your team 15+ hours/week.

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming either:
a) Not a priority right now
b) Wrong timing
c) I'm reaching the wrong person

No worries if it's not a fit! I'll close your file unless I 
hear otherwise.

If I am barking up the wrong tree, who should I talk to about 
sales productivity and automation?

Either way, best of luck scaling the team!

Best,
{{your_name}}

P.S. If timing changes, here's our calendar: [link]
```

**Send timing:** 14 days after Email 1 if no response

---

- {{company}} → Prospect's company name
- {{first_name}} → Prospect's first name
