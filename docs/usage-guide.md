## Core Concepts

### 1. Agents
Specialized AI experts that handle specific GTM tasks:
- **Sales Agents**: Prospecting, qualification, pipeline management
- **Marketing Agents**: Content creation, campaign management, analytics
- **Growth Agents**: Experimentation, analytics, customer success

### 2. Skills
Modular knowledge packages that enhance agent capabilities:
- Activate automatically based on context
- Load progressively to minimize token usage
- Provide deep expertise in specific areas

### 3. Commands
Executable tools for specific tasks:
```bash
/[plugin-name]:[command-name] [parameters]
```

### 4. Orchestrators
Multi-agent workflows for complex operations:
- Coordinate multiple agents
- Handle end-to-end processes
- Optimize resource allocation

#### Orchestration Best Practices
> Derived from GTM Automation Engine's orchestrator system plugins/orchestrator/README.md#1-205.

1. **Assess Complexity First**
   - Orchestrate when work involves 6+ distinct tasks, multiple specialties, or parallel execution opportunities.
   - For simple edits, reply with an "Orchestration Not Needed" note to avoid overhead.
2. **Select the Right Pattern**
   - **Pipeline** for sequential stages (e.g., brief → build → QA → launch).
   - **Diamond/Fan-out** when middle stages can run in parallel (analytics, creative, channel activation).
   - **Iterative/Conditional** for reviews, approvals, or guardrail-triggered branches.
   - Document the pattern choice in the plan so reviewers understand the architecture.
3. **Standard Plan Structure**
   - Include objective, complexity rating, strategy, stages with task IDs, parallelization block, context-passing details, error handling, and success criteria (see GTM Automation Engine JSON example plugins/orchestrator/README.md#283-325).
   - Save plans under `.claude/plans/plan-<timestamp>.json` for auditing and reuse.
4. **Bot + Tool Pairing**
   - Planner agent (Sonnet) designs the workflow.
   - Main Claude executes tasks, referencing the orchestration skill for coordination patterns.
   - Use `docs/gtm-essentials.md` tools inside plans (Serena for code edits, Context7 for docs, Sequential Thinking for retros, Playwright for QA).
5. **Error Handling & Guardrails**
   - Define retry strategy (immediate vs with-modification) and max retries.
   - Provide fallbacks for missing agents or tool failures.
   - Set escalation criteria (e.g., escalate to RevOps lead if forecast plan fails twice).
6. **Review Checklist**
   - Confirm agent availability and required tools per task.
   - Validate dependencies and parallel groups.
   - Ensure success criteria + deliverables map to user goals.
   - Once approved, track execution status and update plan if scope changes.

Use this checklist whenever authoring or reviewing GTM orchestration plans to stay aligned with GTM Automation Engine's orchestration standards.

## Common Workflows

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Clear Objectives
Before using any plugin, define:
- What you want to achieve
- Success metrics
- Timeline and resources

### 2. Use Progressive Complexity
- Start with simple commands
- Add parameters as needed
- Move to orchestrators for complex workflows

### 3. Leverage Skills Intelligently
Skills activate automatically, but you can also:
- Request specific expertise
- Combine multiple skills
- Build on previous context

### 4. Monitor and Iterate
- Track command outputs
- Measure results against objectives
- Refine parameters based on performance

### Getting Help

1. **Check Documentation**
   ```bash
   /help [plugin-name]
   ```

2. **Debug Mode**
   ```bash
   /debug on
   [run command]
   /debug off
   ```

## Tips & Tricks

### 1. Save Common Workflows
Create aliases for frequently used commands:
```bash
/alias create lead-gen "/sales-prospecting:generate-leads --criteria 'B2B SaaS' --enrich comprehensive"
```

### 2. Use Templates
Many commands support templates:
```bash
/email-marketing:design-campaign --template "webinar-followup"
```

### 3. Bulk Operations
Process multiple items efficiently:
```bash
/sales-prospecting:enrich-bulk --file "prospects.csv"
```

### 4. Schedule Recurring Tasks
```bash
/schedule weekly "/customer-analytics:health-scores --alert-on-risk"
```

## Contributor Automation & Quality Gates

Even though this guide focuses on using the marketplace, creators shipping new assets should follow the built-in tooling:

1. **Scaffold Templates Quickly**
   ```bash
   python scripts/scaffold_asset.py agent plugins/example/agents/new-agent.md
   python scripts/scaffold_asset.py command plugins/example/commands/run-new.md
   python scripts/scaffold_asset.py skill plugins/example/skills/new-skill/SKILL.md
   ```
   These commands copy the canonical structure from `templates/` so frontmatter, sections, and formatting stay consistent.

2. **Local Husky Hook** – every commit automatically runs `scripts/validate_marketplace.py` and `scripts/smoke_test_plugins.py`. Fix failures locally before pushing.

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow** – `.github/workflows/quality-checks.yml` repeats the validator + smoke suite on all pushes/PRs to block regressions in CI.

4. **Documentation Updates** – whenever assets change, update README + docs (usage guide, references) in the same PR to keep parity with the quality gates.

## Security & Compliance

### Data Handling
- All data processed follows GDPR/CCPA guidelines
- PII is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Audit logs maintained for compliance

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- API key management
- IP whitelisting available

### Best Practices
1. Never share API credentials
2. Use read-only access where possible
3. Regularly rotate keys
4. Monitor usage logs

## Performance Optimization

### Token Usage
- Skills use progressive disclosure
- Agents selected based on task complexity
- Batch operations to reduce overhead

### Speed Optimization
- Haiku models for routine tasks
- Sonnet models for complex reasoning
- Parallel processing where applicable

### Cost Management
- Monitor token consumption
- Use appropriate enrichment levels
- Cache frequently accessed data
