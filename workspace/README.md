## Usage Guidelines

### Client Projects
Create a subfolder for each client under `clients/`:
```
clients/
├── acme-corp/
│   ├── briefs/
│   ├── deliverables/
│   └── notes/
└── techstart-inc/
    ├── briefs/
    └── deliverables/
```

### Campaign Organization
Organize campaigns by quarter or initiative:
```
campaigns/
├── 2025-q1-product-launch/
├── 2025-q2-abm-enterprise/
└── ongoing-nurture/
```

### Content Workflow
Structure content by type and status:
```
content/
├── blog/
│   ├── drafts/
│   ├── review/
│   └── published/
├── whitepapers/
└── case-studies/
```

### Lead Management
Organize leads by source and stage:
```
leads/
├── inbound/
├── outbound/
├── enriched/
└── qualified/
```

## Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase with hyphens: `q1-campaign-brief.md`
- Include dates where relevant: `2025-01-15-pipeline-report.csv`
- Prefix drafts: `draft-blog-post-ai-sales.md`
- Prefix finals: `final-case-study-acme.pdf`

## File Types

| Extension | Use For |
|-----------|---------|
| `.md` | Documents, briefs, strategies |
| `.csv` | Lead lists, data exports |
| `.json` | Structured data, configurations |
| `.xlsx` | Spreadsheets, reports |
| `.pdf` | Final deliverables |

## Agent Outputs

When agents generate outputs, they should save to the appropriate folder:
- Lead generation → `leads/`
- Content creation → `content/`
- Campaign plans → `campaigns/`
- Research findings → `research/`
- Performance data → `reports/` or `analytics/`
