## Step 1: Install Claude Code

### What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps you automate tasks, generate content, and streamline your work. Think of it as having an expert assistant who knows everything about sales, marketing, and growth.

### Installation Steps

### Native / Script Installer (Recommended)
*macOS / Linux / WSL:*
```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash
```

*Windows PowerShell:*
```powershell
irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

*Windows CMD:*
```cmd
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.cmd -o install.cmd && install.cmd && del install.cmd
```

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
```bash
brew install --cask claude-code
```

### NPM (Node.js 18+ required)
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
**Note:** Avoid using `sudo npm install -g` to prevent permission issues.

---

### Authentication & First Run
1.  Open a terminal and navigate into your project directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/project
    ```
2.  Run Claude Code:
    ```bash
    claude
    ```
3.  You’ll be prompted to log in. You can sign in via:
    *   A Claude.ai account (Pro/Max subscription)
    *   Claude Console (API-key based)

4.  After login you’ll see the Claude Code interface. To verify it’s working, try:

    **Verify installation**
    - You should see the Claude Code interface with a chat window
    - Type "Hello" to confirm Claude responds

> **✨ Success!** If Claude responds to your message, you're ready to move on.

---

## Step 2: Set Up Your First Workspace

### What is a Workspace?

A workspace is like a project folder where Claude Code can access and manage files. For GTM Automation Engine, you'll create a workspace to organize your sales, marketing, and growth work.

### Creating Your Workspace

1.  **Create a folder on your computer**
    ```
    📁 Documents/
       └── 📁 GTM-Work/
    ```
    - On **macOS**: Create a folder in your Documents called "GTM-Work"
    - On **Windows**: Create a folder in your Documents called "GTM-Work"

2.  **Open the folder in Claude Code**
    - In Claude Code, click **File → Open Folder** (or similar menu option)
    - Navigate to your newly created `GTM-Work` folder
    - Click **Select Folder** or **Open**

3.  **Confirm workspace is active**
    - You should see your folder name in the Claude Code sidebar or title bar
    - The workspace is now ready for use

> **💡 Tip:** You can create multiple workspaces for different projects (e.g., "Sales-Projects", "Marketing-Campaigns", etc.)

---

## Step 3: Add the GTM Automation Engine Marketplace

### What is a Marketplace?

A marketplace is a collection of plugins (tools and agents) that you can install. The GTM Automation Engine marketplace contains 67 specialized plugins for sales, marketing, and growth teams.

### Adding the Marketplace

1.  **Open the chat in Claude Code**
    - Make sure you're in your GTM-Work workspace

2.  **Type the following command** in the chat:
    ```
    /plugin marketplace add tejaskembalkar-ship-it/gtm-automation-engine
    ```

3.  **Wait for confirmation**
    - Claude will respond confirming the marketplace has been added
    - This makes all 67 plugins available for installation but **does not load any agents or tools** into your context.

4.  **Browse available plugins** (optional)
    - Type `/plugin` to see all available plugins
    - You'll see a list organized by category

> **✨ Success!** You now have access to all GTM plugins, but they're not loaded yet (which saves memory and keeps things fast).
